tiptap is a headless wrapper around [ProseMirror](https://ProseMirror.net) – a toolkit for building rich text WYSIWYG editors, which is already in use at many well-known companies such as _New York Times_, _The Guardian_ or _Atlassian_.

Create exactly the rich text editor you want out of customizable building blocks. tiptap comes with sensible defaults, a lot of extensions and a friendly API to customize every aspect. It’s backed by a welcoming community, open source, and free.

## What does “headless” mean?

There is no provided user interface, you are absolutely free to build whatever interface you want. No need to overwrite any class, to use `!important` or other hacks, just write whatever you like in the setup you are used to.
